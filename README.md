# Reinforcement Learning Simulations

A collection of interactive reinforcement learning environments and simulations demonstrating various AI techniques, from tactical combat scenarios to continuous control problems. Each project showcases different aspects of RL with comprehensive visualizations and educational materials.

## Projects Overview

### üê† Fish Tank RL (`tank-sim/`)
**Advanced continuous control environment with physics simulation**

A sophisticated reinforcement learning environment where an AI agent learns to navigate a fish to the center of a tank while dealing with dynamic water currents. Features modern Actor-Critic algorithms, real-time training visualization, and interactive web demos.

**Key Features:**
- A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) implementation with GAE
- Physics-based fish movement with realistic water dynamics
- Dynamic water currents that evolve over time
- Real-time training visualization with matplotlib
- Interactive web-based simulator with live controls
- Comprehensive model saving/loading system
