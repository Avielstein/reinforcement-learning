## Target Behavior (What We Want to Implement)

### Core Locomotion Mechanism
- **Jet Propulsion**: Volume-based water displacement for thrust
- **Expansion Cycle**: Contract → suck water in → expand → expel water → thrust forward
- **Pulsing Motion**: Rhythmic expansion/contraction like jellyfish
- **Natural Spring-Back**: Passive return to expanded state after contraction

### Visual Morphing
- **Body Shape**: Smooth barrel/ellipsoid (not origami)
- **State Changes**: 
  - **Contracted**: More spherical, smaller volume
  - **Expanded**: Ellipsoidal, larger volume
- **Smooth Transitions**: Gradual morphing between states

## Key Research Insights

### Biological Inspiration
- **Salps**: Barrel-shaped marine invertebrates
- **Natural Behavior**: Rapid body cavity volume changes
- **Water Flow**: Front aperture intake → rear funnel expulsion
- **Multi-Agent**: Can form "salp chains" for coordinated swimming

### Performance Characteristics
- **Swimming Speed**: ~6.7 cm/s (0.2 body lengths/s)
- **Multi-Robot Benefits**: 9% velocity increase, 16% acceleration boost when coordinated
- **Energy Efficiency**: Cost of transport ~2.0
- **Bidirectional**: Forward and reverse propulsion possible

## Implementation Focus

### Essential Mechanics for Simulation
1. **Volume-Based Physics**
   - Body size changes drive water displacement
   - Larger volume change = more thrust
   - Simple expansion/contraction timing

2. **Propulsion Cycle**
   - **Phase 1**: Contract body (motor + tendon simulation)
   - **Phase 2**: Natural spring-back expansion
   - **Result**: Directional water jet → forward thrust

3. **Visual Representation**
   - Smooth ellipsoid body (no complex geometry)
   - Dynamic size scaling during cycles
   - Optional: translucent/transparent appearance

### Multi-Agent Possibilities
- **Chain Formation**: Physical connections between agents
- **Coordinated Pulsing**: Synchronized or asynchronous cycles
- **Collective Benefits**: Improved swimming performance

## Additional Research - Dubins Vehicle Dynamics

### Key Papers Added:
1. **"Closed-Form Solutions for Minimum-Time Paths of Dubins Airplane in Steady Wind"** (2024)
   - ArXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04797
   - Dubins vehicle path planning with wind effects
   - CSC, CCC, SC, CC path configurations

2. **"3D Dubins Curve-Based Path Planning for UUV in Unknown Environments Using an Improved RRT* Algorithm"** (2025)
   - MDPI: https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/13/7/1354
   - 3D Dubins curves for underwater vehicles
   - Nonholonomic constraints for UUVs

### Dubins Vehicle Principles:
- **Constant Forward Speed**: Vehicle always moves forward at fixed velocity
- **Minimum Turning Radius**: Cannot turn sharper than r_min constraint
- **Path Segments**: Combinations of straight lines (S) and circular arcs (C)
- **Optimal Paths**: CSC (curve-straight-curve), CCC (curve-curve-curve), etc.
- **No Lateral Movement**: Cannot move sideways (nonholonomic constraint)

### Critical Implementation Corrections:

#### **Breathing Cycle Timing**:
- **Previous**: 12 frames (0.2 seconds) - WAY TOO FAST
- **Corrected**: 2-3 seconds per phase (120-180 frames at 60fps)
- **Biological Reality**: Salps have slow, deliberate breathing cycles underwater

#### **Control Scheme**:
- **Previous**: Binary pulse trigger (instant on/off)
- **Corrected**: Hold-to-inhale system
  - **Hold SPACE**: Slow contraction (inhale water)
  - **Release SPACE**: Slow expansion (exhale water → thrust)
- **Underwater Physics**: Everything slower due to water resistance

#### **Movement Dynamics**:
- **Add Dubins Constraints**: Minimum turning radius for realistic movement
- **Body Orientation**: Agent points in movement direction
- **Smooth Turns**: No sharp direction changes, only curved paths
- **Forward Thrust**: Always in direction of body orientation

### Implementation Priority:
1. **Slow breathing cycles** (2-3 second phases)
2. **Hold-to-inhale controls** (space bar mechanics)
3. **Dubins vehicle dynamics** (turning radius constraints)
4. **Smooth body orientation** (gradual direction changes)
